About me
======
I am interested in the understanding of the origins and maintenance of high levels of tropical species diversity, plant ecology, plant-animal interactions, and regeneration dynamics of tropical forests.

Currently my research is focused on the early life stages of trees, namely seeds and young seedlings. I aim to quantify how local factors shape regeneration in secondary forests using a combination of observational and experimental approaches. My goal is to identify factors affecting regeneration processes in secondary forests community assembly, such as how variation in tree species composition and abundance affect seed rain arriving in secondary forest fragments. Also, how trophic interactions involving mammalian herbivores affect the probability of successful seedling establishment.
